    "<p> In previous chapter, brief information about Ridge and LASSO are explained. When I first learned about these machine learning techniques, I thought LASSO would be more efficient and helpful tool as it can do the variable selection. As the course that I learned these was introductory course for machine learning, the course intended to put more weight on introducing various types of machine learning. So I moved on to the next topics without having more time to unleash my curiosity if LASSO really is a better option than Ridge. I took couple more courses about machine learning and one professor said that Ridge has better performance over LASSO when variables are highly correlated. So, in this chapter, I will generate data to compare performances in 3 different levels of correlation.  "
